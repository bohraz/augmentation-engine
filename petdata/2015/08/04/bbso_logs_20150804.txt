+------   CONCLUDING REMARKS   ------------------------------------------------+

H-alpha telescope: Normal full disk synoptic observations. The filter sequence was set at 9 line center and one -0.75A offset frames at a 60 second cadence. 

NST: PCO/TiO, VIS/Ha & NIRIS/1565nm polarimetry of several filaments including regions in NOAA 12393, 12394 and 12396. Seeing was fair to good most of day. AO did a good job of locking on granulation for the filaments without a photospheric feature.
