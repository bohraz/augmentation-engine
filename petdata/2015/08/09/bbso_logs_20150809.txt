+------   CONCLUDING REMARKS   ------------------------------------------------+

H-alpha telescope: Normal full disk synoptic observations. The filter sequence was set at 9 line center and one -0.75A offset frames at a 60 second cadence. 

NST: PCO/TiO, VIS/Ha & NIRIS/1565nm polarimetry of the trailing region near the neutral line in NOAA 12396. 

No network problems noticed today. The temporery network switches installed appear to be working.
