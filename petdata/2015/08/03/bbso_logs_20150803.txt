+------   CONCLUDING REMARKS   ------------------------------------------------+

H-alpha telescope: Normal full disk synoptic observations. The filter sequence was set at 9 line center and one -0.75A offset frames at a 60 second cadence. Observing terminated due to clouds in the early afternoon

NST: PCO/TiO, VIS/Ha & NIRIS/1565nm polarimetry of a filament a bit west of disk center. Around midday, the telescope was moved to a prominence off the east limb for VIS/Ha observations without AO. Shortly after starting the limb observations, clouds moved in leading to the telescope being closed at 3pm. 

The TPTS testker was showing a "ephemeris update returned BADXY. ephemeris update error -2". Restarting TPTS did not clear the repeating message. This, however, did not appear to effect opperation.
