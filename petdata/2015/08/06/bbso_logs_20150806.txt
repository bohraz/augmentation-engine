16:05:11  Dome open. Slewing to disk center and opening M1 cover. Begining
          instrument setup and calibration.
16:08:25  Cloud. Mirror cover closing.
16:18:58  Reopening and continuing setup.
16:31:52  Centered on a pore near the trailing spot of NOAA 12396. AO
          was locked just as another cloud drifted into the field.

16:56:45  Stopping observations. Moved to quiet sun for flat fields. 
          Wobbling with the telescope mount and the tip/tilt mirror.
17:05:44  Returned to the target in NOAA 12396. Resume observations.
17:55:19  Clouds becoming thick and have moved over the dome. Closing
          down.
18:06:38  Mount stowed. Dome closed to storm stow position. It is now
          raining!
18:34:43  Drives off. Taking darks.
18:44:47  AO off. Coude instruments powered down and covered.


+------   CONCLUDING REMARKS   ------------------------------------------------+

Both telescope were opened for normal operations. The H-alpha telescope started normal full disk synoptic observations. The NST targeted a filament in NOAA 12396 where a pore provided a target for the AO to lock onto. Instruments used were the PCO/TiO, VIS/Ha & NIRIS/1565nm polarimetry. Around 11 am, dark clouds gathered and both domes were closed just as rain began.
