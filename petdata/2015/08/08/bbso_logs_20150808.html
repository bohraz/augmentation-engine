<H3>H-alpha Telescope</H3>
<P><PRE>16:23:22  H-alpha   Fulldisk   Zeiss   HaCL   0.25A   Pulnix   full disk
16:23:23  Start observations.  P angle set by program.  Cadence 60 sec.
          Filter: 9 frames at H-alpha center line, 1 frame at Ha -0.75A.
          Late start due to still bringing up network.
19:12:24  Morning flat field acquired and accepted.
20:14:07  Meridian flip completed.
20:41:05  Afternoon flat field acquired and accepted.
01:00:44  Stop observations.  Telescope stowed, dome closed.</PRE>

<H3>NST</H3>
<P><PRE>16:24:29  Need to get a couple more systems online before I can start
          NST.
17:01:07  We now have enough connections to run NST.  No problems
          so far.
17:16:10  No Dec force or counterweight motion.  Stop!  Restow telescope.
          Will reboot DFM computers.
17:33:15  DFM TCS#1 does not respond to pings.  Not sure if this is
          normal.  Clearly TPTS can communicate with DFM TCS#1.
17:47:09  Seems OK now after rebooting.  DFM TCS#2 is moving
          force motors and counterweights correctly now.
17:58:33  No ping response probably due to Windows firewall settings.
18:05:44  Open M1, at disk center.  All systems OK for now.
18:19:29  Rezero guider. Off about 30arcsec in both axes.
18:26:18  Problem with AO308.  May be a loose cable.  Checking.
18:42:22  Now crazy screen on AO308.  Windows Start menu
          keeps disappearing.  Power cycle!
18:44:57  Now no camera image on AO308.
19:04:28  Apparently there is a loose connector on the back of
          the Bittware box that is supposed to go to one of the
          DSPs.  Don't know which one.
19:35:51  Nicolas is here.  We are working on the problem.
          M1 closed for now.  Network is OK.
20:06:00  AO working now.
20:15:58  Start TiO PCO and VIS on region NOAA 12396.
20:22:19  Start NIRIS.  Scan -1000 to 2036 by 33 steps.  Polarimetry
          mode.  16-bit FPI peak 27307, 12-bit peak -37.
20:23:44  TiO PCO, 15 sec cadence, 1 ms exp, 100 fr/burst, 70 best.
          VIS, 60 fr/burst, 25 best.  delay 15 sec, offset 0 steps
          +/- 0.8A  9 ms
          +/- 0.6A  12 ms
          +/- 0.4A  15 ms
              0.0A  20 ms

20:24:02  NST        101W   384S   Active Region    NOAA 12396
          Coude1          Int.	 7057 	10A 	PCO	 77
          Coude2          VIS	 Ha line walk 	0.08A 	PCO	 70
          Coude3          NIRIS	 1565nm	 	Teledyne 80
          Nasmyth        None	  	 	None	 
20:41:20  Seeing not as good now.
21:39:44  Lost lock.  TPTS got in a funny state and I had to crash
          out of it.  Lost the guider rezeroing for today.
22:07:20  Stop for flats.
22:11:20  Starting flat fields.
22:27:22  Resume observations.  Seeing not as good as earlier.
22:40:11  Stop observations.  Seeing is poor.
23:17:14  Telescope stowed, dome closed.</PRE>

<H3>Concluding Remarks</H3>
<P>Late start today due to continuing computer network repair
and problems with AO308.  Full disk H-alpha operated normally.

NST observed region NOAA 12396 using TiO PCO, VIS and NIRIS.
No flares noted.
