+------   CONCLUDING REMARKS   ------------------------------------------------+

H-alpha telescope: Normal full disk synoptic observations. The filter sequence was set at 9 line center and one -0.75A offset frames at a 60 second cadence. 

NST: PCO/TiO, VIS/Ha & NIRIS/1565nm polarimetry of filaments. Seeing was fair to poor. When seeing was too poor to lock on granulation, the target was changed to NOAA 12394. Note that the VIS wavelegth offsets were changed a few times through the day. Flats and darks were taken all offsets.
