Header is given as a dict, should I convert it into a list?


Fix image error from __name == main
Extend compose with image class
Benchmark

heliographic_transformation.py imports numpy as np, redlines because numpy is not in the project requirements(requirements.txt?), but it is in the requirements_backup.txt so should I be using that one?

Two commits reference heliographic_transformation.py. No functional difference between them.

Worked before because bbox and ann_obj(header) data manually entered in if name == main part at bottom of heliographic_transformation.py when running script directly, which explains the lack of relative import for projection_helper at top of script.

Even that part doesn't work unless I manually add an image since the image used is a reference to Shreejaa's file path.

Potential solutions:

1. Extend PyTorch Compose to handle a Special Image Class that includes metadata (I think this might be the best).
2. Modify Heliographic to expect Metadata from external source.
3. Apply Heliographic in the data-loading loop instead of T.Compose.

1. Extend PyTorch Compose to Handle Special Image Class(my favorite)

    How it works:
	Custom Image Class that holds all potentially necessary data about an image like header, image, bbox.
	Override Compose's __call__ method to take in a CustomImage.
	CustomComposeCall should check if the transform being applied is native or customly made.
	If native then only pass the image, else pass the image class which includes the data list as expected.

2. Modify Heliographic to Expect Metadata from External Source
Instead of passing the annotation data inside the __call__ method, fetch it during execution.

    How it works:
        When __call__ executes, it fetches the correct annotation data based on the image being processed.

3. Apply Heliographic in Dataset or DataLoader Loop

Instead of trying to fit your transform into T.Compose, apply it within the data-loading loop.

    How it works:
        In your training or inference loop, after loading the image and annotation, manually apply the Heliographic transform before sending the data to the model.

I kept getting image dimensions incompatible with ilat and ilon error, so I tried various ways of resizing the image to fit. That yielded transformations on the entire image, rather than just the filament.

The issue came from processing the entire BBSO image instead of just the filament. I converted the image to a numpy array and sliced it using the bounding box data to get just the filament. It seems to work now.

Issue 1: Whenever I turn grid on, there are two grids instead of just one. I'm not sure if that's a serious problem or not, but if it's worth it I could figure out why that's happening.

Issue 2: Whenever bcorrect is set above 91, the following warning is sent
UserWarning: The input coordinates to pcolormesh are interpreted as cell centers, but are not monotonically increasing or decreasing. This may lead to incorrectly calculated cell edges, in which case, please supply explicit cell edges to pcolormesh.
  ax.pcolormesh(self.ilon, self.ilat, cutout, cmap='gray', shading='nearest')


Point of reference wrong
Image incorrect / data incorrect from json value

To Do:
Draw bounding box around filament in original image to verify location working with is correct
Full image transformation like the slideshow
Run Mercator projection, see what it gives, maybe some are coming from there. (run each file with a __name__ = __main__). Mercator was supposed to be related to heliographic in some way.
Understand exactly what pcolormesh/pcolor does in heliographic.

Take more initiative.
